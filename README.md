# Backend for Blog Application

This is the Node.js backend for a blogging website built using Express. It handles all the API requests for the frontend.

## Features

- REST API to manage blog posts (CRUD operations)
- Integrated with MongoDB for data storage
- Authentication endpoints to handle user login and registration (optional details based on your implementation)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB (local setup or MongoDB Atlas)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-blog-app-node.git
   cd backend-blog-app-node
   ```

2. Install NPM packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your MongoDB URI and any other configurations

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will run your backend on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system (if applicable):

```bash
npm test
```

## API Reference

Depending on the routes you have developed, list all the available endpoints and how to use them:

- **GET /api/posts** - Retrieves all posts
- **POST /api/posts** - Creates a new post, request body should include title and content
- **GET /api/posts/:id** - Retrieves a post by its ID
- **PUT /api/posts/:id** - Updates a post by its ID, request body should include title and/or content
- **DELETE /api/posts/:id** - Deletes a post by its ID

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system. Example using Heroku:

1. Create a Heroku account and log in
2. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create
   ```
3. Set your environment variables in Heroku:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
   ```
4. Push to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
